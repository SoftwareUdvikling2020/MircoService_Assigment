# MircoService_Assigment


### Deployment on Kubernetes
We are using Kubernetes via Docker Desktop. 
Our own micro service as well as Dora's Car projects are dockerized with a simple dockerfile:
```YML
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine
ARG JAR_FILE=target/*.jar
COPY ${JAR_FILE} app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app.jar"]
```
And deployed on kubernetes. 

### Observations
We could not get Eureka to work together with Kubernetes, so we ended up not using it. 
Kubernetes deployments can be exposed as a service, and with that we balance load (instead of using Ribbon as was provided)
